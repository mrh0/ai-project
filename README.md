# Deploy
To deploy the project prototype you will need the following dependencies:
Python 3 (with pip), which can be obtained from https://www.python.org/downloads/ [2].
Tensorflow 2, which can be installed with the command pip install tensorflow [3].

EMNIST, which can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist and should be placed in the ‘data’ directory [4].
You will also need a development environment which can read and display Python notebook files (.ipynb), Visual Studio: Code is the development environment that was used in this project, it can be obtained from https://code.visualstudio.com/.
And lastly, all the files from the project repository at https://github.com/mrh0/ai-project where all the sections of code in the prototype have been commented with a short overview into what that particular section does.
